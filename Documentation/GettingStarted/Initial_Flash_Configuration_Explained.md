40. `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_INTERRUPTSTACK=y` #

                                     <br> symbol will be the size of the interrupt stack in bytes.  If not defined or zero the user
                                     <br> tasks will be used during interrupt handling

42. `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_HIPRI_INTERRUPT=y` # This board has High Priority Interrupts:
```
NOTE: This description is currently unique to the Cortex-M family which is the only family that currently supports this feature. The general feature is not conceptually unique to the Cortex-M but it is extended to any other family, then this discussion will have to be generalized.

If ARMV7M_USEBASEPRI is selected, then interrupts will be disabled by setting the BASEPRI register to NVIC_SYSH_DISABLE_PRIORITY so that most interrupts will not have execution priority. SVCall must have execution priority in all cases.

In the normal cases, interrupts are not nest-able and all interrupts run at an execution priority between NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MIN and NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MAX (with NVIC_SYSH_PRIORITY_MAX reserved for SVCall).

If, in addition, ARCH_HIPRI_INTERRUPT is defined, then special high priority interrupts are supported. These are not "nested" in the normal sense of the word. These high priority interrupts can interrupt normal processing but execute outside of OS (although they can "get back into the game" via a PendSV interrupt).

How do you specify a high priority interrupt? You need to do two things:

1) You need to change the address in the vector table so that
the high priority interrupt vectors to your special C
interrupt handler.  There are two ways to do this:
a) If you select CONFIG_ARCH_RAMVECTORS, then vectors will
be kept in RAM and the system will support the interface:
int up_ramvec_attach(int irq, up_vector_t vector)
that can be used to attach your C interrupt handler to the
vector at run time.
b) Alternatively, you could keep your vectors in FLASH but in
order to this, you would have to develop your own custom
vector table.
2) Then set the priority of your interrupt to NVIC to
NVIC_SYSH_HIGH_PRIORITY using the standard interface:
int up_prioritize_irq(int irq, int priority)
NOTE: ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK must be set in kernel mode (BUILD_KERNEL). In kernel mode without an interrupt stack, the interrupt handler will set the MSP to the stack pointer of the interrupted thread. If the interrupted thread was a privileged thread, that will be the MSP otherwise it will be the PSP. If the PSP is used, then the value of the MSP will be invalid when the interrupt handler returns because it will be a pointer to an old position in the unprivileged stack. Then when the high priority interrupt occurs and uses this stale MSP, there will most likely be a system failure.

If the interrupt stack is selected, on the other hand, then the interrupt handler will always set the the MSP to the interrupt stack. So when the high priority interrupt occurs, it will either use the MSP of the last privileged thread to run or, in the case of the nested interrupt, the interrupt stack if no privileged task has run

43. `CONFIG_LIB_BOARDCTL=y` # Enable boardctl() interface, Architecture specific logic must provide board_app_initialize() interface.

44. `CONFIG_BOARDCTL_USBDEVCTRL=y` # Enable USB device controls, support for the BOARDIOC_USBDEV_CONTROL boardctrl() command

45. `CONFIG_DISABLE_OS_API=y` # Disable NuttX interfaces

                                <br> timer is expected to run at 100Hz or USEC_PER_TICK=10000.  This setting must be defined to inform
                                <br> NuttX the interval that the processor hardware is providing the system timer interrupts to the OS

48. `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_TIMEKEEPING=y` # Set by the board selection, not necessarily used

50. `CONFIG_START_MONTH=1` # System starts in Jan

51. `CONFIG_START_DAY=27` # System starts on the 27

52. `CONFIG_MAX_WDOGPARMS=2` # Maximum number of parameters that can be passed to a watchdog handler

52. `CONFIG_PREALLOC_WDOGS=8` # The number of pre-allocated watchdog structures.  The system manages a pool of watchdog structures to
                    <br> minimize dynamic allocations.  Dynamic allocations will still be made if this pool is exhausted.
                    <br> You will, however, get better performance and memory usage if this value is tuned to minimize such allocations

53. `CONFIG_WDOG_INTRESERVE=1` # Watchdog structures reserved for interrupt handlers.  Watchdog structures may be allocated from normal
                <br> task and alo from interrupt handlers.  Interrupt handlers, however, can only use pre-allocated watchdog structures
                <br> Therefore, in order to keep normal task allocations from exhausting all watchdog structures, a small number of

                            <br> Excludes the NUL terminator; the actual allocated size will be TASK_NAME_SIZE+1, therefore
                            <br> the default value of 31 results in an align-able 32 byte allocation

59. `CONFIG_MAX_TASKS=16` # The maximum number of simultaneously active tasks.  This value must be a power of two

60. `CONFIG_SCHED_WAITPID=y` # Enables the waitpid() interface in a default, non-standard mode.  Non-standard in the sense that
                        <br> the waited for PID need not be child of the caller.  IF SCHED_HAVE_PARENT is also defined, then 
                        <br> this setting will modify the behavior of waitpid() making it more specification compiant and will
                        <br> enable the waitid() and wait() interfaces as well

61. `CONFIG_PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST=y` # TODO this is undocumented

70. `CONFIG_SIG_SIGCONDTIMEDOUT=16` # This non-standard signal number is used in the implementation of pthread_cond_timedwait()

71. `CONFIG_PREALLOC_MQ_MSGS=4` # The number of pre-allocated messge structurs.  The system manages a pool of preallocated message 
                            <br> structures to minimize dynamic allocations

72. `CONFIG_MQ_MAXMSGSIZE=32` # Message strucutes are allocated with a fixed payload size given by this setting.

74. `CONFIG_USERMAIN_STACKSIZE=2048` # The size of the stack to allocate for the user initialization thread that is started as soon
                            <br> as the OS completes initialization

76. `CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT=2048` # Default pthread stack size

77. `CONFIG_DISABLE_POLL=y` # The size s of drives can be reduced in the poll() method is not supported.  If you do not use poll() or

                            <br> same size as the maxpacket size. That is because IN transfers of exactly the max packet size
                            <br> will be followed by a NULL packet.  The BULKOUT request buffer size is always the same as the
                            <br> max packet size.

115. `CONFIG_CDCACM_RXBUFSIZE=256` # Recieve buffer size. The actual amout of data that can be held in the buffer is  this number

                                <br> will hold four full-speed, 64 byte packets.  A buffer size of 513 will hold one high-speed

                                <br> minus one due to the way that the circualr buffer is managed.  So a TX buffer size of 769 
                                <br> will hold one request of size 768 and a buffer size of 193 will hold two requests of size 96

116. `CONFIG_CDCACM_VENDORID=0x0525` # The vendor ID code/string.  Default 0x0525 and "NuttX".  0x0525 is the Netchip vendor and 
                                <br> should not be used in any products.  This default VID was selected for compatibility with the

120. `CONFIG_SYSLOG_CHAR=y` # Enable the generic character device for the SYSLOG.  The full path to the SYSLOG device is provided by
                        <br> SYSLOG_DEVPATH.  A valid character device (or file) must exist at this path.  It will be opened
                        <br> by syslog_initialize

121. `CONFIG_SYSLOG_CHAR_CRLF=y` # Pre-pend a carraig return before every linefeed that goes to the character device

122. `CONFIG_SYSLOG_DEVPATH="/dev/ttyS0"` # The full path to the system logging device

123. `CONFIG_FS_READABLE=y` # Automatically selected if any readable file system is selected

124. `CONFIG_FS_MQUEUE_MPATH="/var/mqueue"` # The path to where POSIX message queues will exist in the VFS namespace

125. `CONFIG_FS_PROCFS=y` # The PROCFS file system provides access to task status and other driver status through the NuttX file system
                        <br> the PROCFS may, for example, be mounted at /proc.  Then information about all of the currently active
                        <br> tasks and threads will be available in /proc

126. `CONFIG_MM_REGIONS=2` # If th architecute includes multiple, non-contiguous regions of memory to allocate from this specifies
                            <br> the number of memory regions that the memory manager must handle and enables the API

                        <br> if FS_BINFS is defined retaining those names in a file system from which they can be executed.  This
                        <br> feature is also the underlying requirement to support built-n application in the NuttShell.
                        <br> NOTE: this feature is highly coupled with logic in the apps/ sub-directory and as a consequence cannont be 
                        <br> used in environments that do not include the standard NuttX apps/ nor in build configurations using
                        <br> either BUILD_PROTECTED or BUILD_KERNEL

128. `CONFIG_STDIO_BUFFER_SIZE=64` # Size of buffers using within the C buffered I/O interfaces 
                        <br> (printf, putchar, fwrite, etc.). This function sets the initial 
                        <br> I/O buffer size. Zero disables I/O buffering initially. Any 
                        <br> buffer size may be subsequently modified using setvbuf(). 

129. `CONFIG_STDIO_LINEBUFFER=y` # Sets the default behavior to flush buffered I/O whenever 
                        <br> a newline character is found in the output data stream. This 
                        <br> setting just sets the initial default behavior of all streams. 
                        <br> The behavior of an individual stream can be changed via setvbuf().

130. `CONFIG_NUNGET_CHARS=2` # Number of characters that can be buffered by ungetc() 

131. `CONFIG_LIBC_LONG_LONG=y` # Enables support for long long formats in printf, sscanf, etc. 
                            <br> This is enabled by default but if you are trying to reduce 
                            <br> the FLASH footprint, then disabling this feature is one option. 
                            <br> The FLASH saves comes not from disabling the long long formats, 
                            <br> but rather from omitting the large long long arithmetic 
                            <br> libraries that will be drawn into the build if long long 
                            <br> support is enabled.

132. `CONFIG_EOL_IS_EITHER_CRLF=y` # EOL is CR or LF

133. `CONFIG_ARCH_LOWPUTC=y` # architecture supports low-level, boot time console output

135. `CONFIG_LIB_HOMEDIR="/"`` # The home directory to use with operations like such as 'cd ~'

135. `CONFIG_POSIX_SPAWN_PROXY_STACKSIZE=1024` # If posix_spawn[p]() and task_spawn() use I/O 
                            <br> redirection options, they will require an intermediary/proxy 
                            <br> task to muck with the file descriptors. This configuration 
                            <br> item specifies the stack size used for the proxy.

136. `CONFIG_TASK_SPAWN_DEFAULT_STACKSIZE=2048` # The actual size to use for the child task's 
                            <br> stack can be set with task_spawnattr_setstacksize(). This
                            <br> value specifies the default stack size to use if 
                            <br> task_spawnattr_setstacksize() is not used.

137. `CONFIG_ARCH_HAVE_TLS=y` # Architecture supports thread local storage

138. `CONFIG_LIB_SENDFILE_BUFSIZE=512` #  Size of the I/O buffer to allocate in sendfile()

139. `CONFIG_HAVE_CXX=y` # Toolchain supports C++ and CXX, CXXFLAGS, and COMPILEXX have been 
                            <br> defined in the configurations Make.defs file

140. `CONFIG_HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE=y` # The platform-specific logic includes support for

                            <br> and for the selected toolchain (via up_cxxinitialize()).

141. `CONFIG_BUILTIN_PROXY_STACKSIZE=1024` # If exec_builtin uses I/O redirection options it will 
                            <br> require an intermediary/proxy task to muck with the file 
                            <br> descriptors. This configuration item specifies the stack size 
                            <br> used for the proxy

142. `CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NSH=y` # Enable the NuttShell (NSH) example

143. `CONFIG_EXAMPLES_NSH_CXXINITIALIZE=y` # If HAVE_CXX and HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE are slected, then 
                            <br> this NSH example can be configured to initialize C++ constructors
                            <br> when it is started. NSH does not use C++ and, by default, 
                            <br> assumes that constructors are initialized elsewhere. However, 
                            <br> you can force NSH to initialize constructors by setting this 
                            <br> option.

144. `CONFIG_NSH_LIBRARY=y` # Build the NSH support library. This is used, for example, by 
                            <br> examples/nsh in order to implement the full NuttShell (NSH).

145. `CONFIG_NSH_READLINE=y` # Selects the minimal implementation of readline(). This minimal 
                            <br> implementation provides on backspace for command line editing.

146. `CONFIG_NSH_LINELEN=64` # The maximum length of one command line and of one output line.

147. `CONFIG_NSH_CMDPARMS=y` # If selected, then the output from commands, from file applications
                            <br> and from NSH built-in commands can be used as arguments to other 
                            <br>commands. The entity to be executed is identified by enclosing the
                            <br> command line in back quotes. For example,
```
set FOO `myprogram $BAR`
```
Will execute the program named myprogram passing it the value of the environment variable BAR.
<br> The value of the environment variable FOO is then set output of myprogram on stdout.
<br> Because this feature commits significant resources, it is disabled by default.

148. `CONFIG_NSH_MAXARGUMENTS=6` # The maximum number of NSH command arguments. 

149. `CONFIG_NSH_ARGCAT=y` # Support concatenation of strings with environment variables or 
                            <br> command output. For example:
```
set FOO XYZ
set BAR 123
set FOOBAR ABC_${FOO}_${BAR}
```
would set the environment variable FOO to XYZ, BAR to 123 and FOOBAR to ABC_XYZ_123. If
<br> NSH_ARGCAT is not selected, then a slightly small FLASH footprint results but then also only
<br> simple environment variables like $FOO can be used on the command line.

150. `CONFIG_NSH_NESTDEPTH=3` # The maximum number of nested if-then[-else]-fi sequences that 
                            <br> are permissable. 

151. `CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y` # Support external registered, "built-in" applications that can 
                            <br> be executed from the NSH command line  (see apps/README.txt for 
                            <br> more information). This options requires support for builtin 
                            <br> applications (BUILTIN).

152. `CONFIG_NSH_DISABLE_DATE=y` # TODO what is DATE

                            <br> the MMC/SD minor device number (i.e., the N ini /dev/mmcsdN).

156. `CONFIG_NSH_CMDOPT_DF_H=y` # df: Enable [-h] man-readable format

157. `CONFIG_NSH_CODECS_BUFSIZE=128` # File buffer size used by CODEC commands

159. `CONFIG_NSH_PROC_MOUNTPOINT="/proc"` # procfs mountpoint

160. `CONFIG_NSH_FILEIOSIZE=512` # Size of a static I/O buffer used for file access 
                            <br> (ignored if there is no filesystem)

161. `CONFIG_NSH_CONSOLE=y` # If NSH_CONSOLE is set to 'y', then a character driver console 
                            <br> front-end is selected (/dev/console). Normally, the serial 
                            <br> console device is a UART and RS-232 interface. However, if 
                            <br> USBDEV is defined, then a USB serial device may, instead, be 
                            <br> used if the one of the following are defined: PL2303 and 
                            <br> PL2303_CONSOLE - Set up the Prolifics PL2303 emulation as a 
                            <br> console device at /dev/console. CDCACM and CDCACM_CONSOLE - 
                            <br> Set up the CDC/ACM serial device as a console device at 
                            <br> dev/console. NSH_USBCONSOLE and NSH_USBCONDEV - Sets up some 
                            <br> other USB serial device as the NSH console (not necessarily 
                            <br> dev/console).

162. `CONFIG_NSH_ARCHINIT=y` # Set if your board provides architecture specific initialization 
                            <br> via the board-interface function boardctl(). The boardctl() 
                            <br> function will be called early in NSH initialization to allow 
                            <br> board logic to do such things as configure MMC/SD slots.
