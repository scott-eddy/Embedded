# Scope of this repository
This repository houses my work with the open source RTOS [NuttX](http://nuttx.org/).  Initially
I would like to flesh out my understanding of NuttX, especially how it can be used with the 
[STM32F407 discovery board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html). The
existing documentation for NuttX is difficult to sort through and this is my attempt to make
sense of it all.

## Future work
Pie in the sky ideas for this repo will be added to Projects.
