# Scope of these documents

This documentation is geared towards first time users who are exploring Nuttx for the first time.
People who have just found NuttX and want to know a little more about how it works, and who 
are using NuttX on an STM32F4 Discovery board.  

If this discription fits you the best place to start is with the [initial flashing of the stm32f4discovery board](Initial_Flashing_of_Stm32F4_discovery_board.md)

That document should point you to the other docs as appropriate.
