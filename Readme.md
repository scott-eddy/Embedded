# Scope of this repository
This repository houses my work with the open source RTOS [NuttX](http://nuttx.org/).  Initially
I would like to flesh out my understanding of NuttX, especially how it can be used with the 
[STM32F407 discovery board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html). The
existing documentation for NuttX is difficult to sort through and this is my attempt to make
sense of it all.

If you are just getting started with NuttX as well take a look at the [getting started documentation](Documentation/GettingStarted)

## Future work
Pie in the sky ideas for this repo will be added to Projects.
